So, I am Dzintars Klavins. A guy from **Riga / Latvia / Europe**. Wannabe full-stack software
engineer. :)

According Myers-Briggs personality test [^1] result - INFJ-T (Advocate). Yes, I think
in general people can be categorized in several categories. :)

## How did I ended up there?

Since 2007 I am more or less close to software engineering.

From **2007 to 2011** I was a product owner for in-house intranet for local postal
and courier company. **jQuery** barely was a thing back then. **Google Maps** just came
out. A wild times was then. But we managed to create **PHP** backed software which
still serves its purpose.

From **2011 to 2016** I worked on another similar project but its key difference was
totally different, more open, approach. **Multi-tenant SPA application** with the focus
on cross-tenant collaboration. It used PHP **CodeIgniter** framework and some
"fancy" front-end framework I would not name there. That framework is mostly
dead these days. There I also took **Product Owner** role and the software is still
in the service.

**In 2017** I decided to look closer to the web development (**full-stack**) as my
side-activity. So I invested my free time into **Golang** and **TypeScript** learning.

That led me to bunch of supportive technologies. Build systems, collaboration,
testing, automation, containers and everything in between. You might know how
wild all this field is. But my lighthouse in all this journey was my personal goal to
create my little own SaaS solution. So... I just picked things which might help
me to achieve my goals and discarded any noise. For example, **I discarded
React** just because of my Facebook and my hate against it. I DON'T CARE how great it
is. I DON'T CARE about any argument about it. It is just one of those tech which
I will NEVER use. I think Angular and vanilla **Web Components** are FAR FAR more
sustainable in a long term.

## Current state

These days I am mostly working with {{< badge label="Ansible" icon="ansible" color="E00" alt="Ansible Badge" >}}
and {{< badge label="Terraform" icon="terraform" color="844FBA" alt="Terraform Badge" >}}
to bootstrap my personal development platform which consists of bunch of technologies.
The goal for this year is to get finally back to Go and TypeScript programming.

## Evidence

Most of my journey is documented in abandoned
**[GitHub](https://github.com/dzintars)** projects. There is no single complete
project. Everything is WIP or abandoned.

Even more, lately I am migrating to my own **Gerrit** instance to host all of my code.
I just don't want to "feed the beast". I want to control my resources. I want to
see full analytics. I want to control access. And all that.
**GitHub** doesn't offer anything of that. But it is nice "backup" at expense of
giving away your privacy and possibility of you being removed from your own project.
And overall, owning your own stuff is a good thing. Don't feed the Medium.
Don't feed the GitHub, GitLab and the likes. Heck, don't feed the Google either.
As more you feed them, as more dangerous they become overall.

So, after my PDE will get setup smoothly, I most likely will abandon GitHub entirely.

## Professional interests

I'm mostly interested about the context of logistics and postal services. I am
huge believer that in these old industries there are a lot to improve to speed
up and make more effective process. But it's certainly pretty complex area. In
particular, I thing these industries could be hugely improved by introducing
more real-time data exchange. Not emails. Not EDI (Electronic Data Interchange).
Just pure real-time sub-second interaction and collaboration.

I would like to learn **Java** and **Angular** some day. I don't think they are too
complicated, but I need to find time for that. Not that I would love to use them
in my own projects, but... they are widely adopted in enterprise realm. And bunch
of tools I use, uses Java.

Another area of the interest is **CyberSecurity**. Automated testing. Red
teaming. I am taking some entry level rooms in the [Try Hack Me](https://tryhackme.com).
IMHO in coming years this will be quite requested skills as **AI** are helping not
only for the good guys... :)

## Hobbies

My college education was carpentry. But somehow I left all that thing im my
career. And now I kind of regret that a bit and are bringing it back as my
hobby. Buying new tools, making this and that. On top of that I got suck into
metalworking. I can spend my whole evening just watching people making things
out of metal. So... my summer 2024 project will be making furnace and do some
basic casting.
And leather. I believe wood, metal, leather and stone are the most incredible
materials to work with. I would say - fundamental materials. I like how does
wood with brass looks like. I like, how you can make any piece out of metal. You
can make entire tools out of metal. For example - lathe. ;)
