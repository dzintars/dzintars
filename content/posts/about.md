## Professional interests

I'm mostly interested about the context of logistics and postal services. I am
huge believer that in these old industries there are a lot to improve to speed
up and make more effective process. But it's certainly pretty complex area.

## Hobbies

My college education was carpentry. But somehow I left all that thing im my
career. And now I kind of regret that a bit and are bringing it back as my
hobby. Buying new tools, making this and that. On top of that I got suck into
metalworking. I can spend my whole evening just watching people making things
out of metal. So... my summer 2024 project will be making furnace and do some
basic casting.
And leather. I believe wood, metal, leather and stone are the most incredible
materials to work with. I would say - fundamental materials. I like how does
wood with brass looks like. I like, how you can make any piece out of metal. You
can make entire tools out of metal. For example - lathe. ;)
