## Why

For a long time I didn't care about the note taking too much, thou, I was
writing long MS Word documents with the ideas of the project, user stories and
other things.

It all changed when I switched to the Linux. Because Linux was pretty much new
to me, I had a lot to learn and remember. So, gradually I started to write my
little runbooks to document the steps I took to get to the point B. For example,
how do I create SSH keys. Or how do I configure my firewall. And so on.

## Touch Typing

Almost all of the "productivity'fluencers" never mentions the importance of the
touch typing to get into habit of note taking.
But in my opinion... that is the very first pill, you should take before getting
into note taking. If the typing is the pain for you, then you will not make any
notes, nor note taking system. No... you will take notes, but those will be just
occasional sessions. Not a real note taking.

It changes, when you are able to type just by looking at the screen. Without
hunting for the each letter on the keyboard. Even better, if you can train
yourself up to 150 words per minute (wpm), it means, you are able to type almost
at a speed of your thought.

## Ansible

Over time, after I played with custom runbooks and scripts, I started to write
every little system configuration task in Ansible. This gave me systematic space
to document my findings, to write some readme's etc.
