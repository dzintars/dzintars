## Tinkering with my Hugo blog

I'm still not sure what will I do with it, but... at least this will be done.

I picked Hugo as it seems simple enough for my current needs. Just drop some
markdown and you are done. Sounds good. I don't even plan to customize default
theme for now as typography looks good, theme is supported. Like... there is
everything I need. Most important goal for me is to start accumulate some
content.

~~Hugo seems doesn't support `target="_blank"` for an external links. So, top menu
GitHub link opens in the same tab which I don't like.~~ I just removed it.

I like this [gruvbox](https://hugo-theme-gruvbox.schnerring.net) theme.
