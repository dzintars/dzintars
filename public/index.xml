      <description>Why I had this idea about the highly reactive collaborative web application. After messing around I ended up with PoC which consisted of bunch of Go services and on top of that I somewhat implemented CQRS architecture.

General idea was that websocket is used as protocol. Custom message format is created and synchronized between TypeScript and Go with help of Protocol Buffers, gRPC and few gRPC extensions.</description>

      <description>Tinkering with my Hugo blog I&amp;rsquo;m still not sure what will I do with it, but&amp;hellip; at least this will be done.
I picked Hugo as it seems simple enough for my current needs. Just drop some markdown and you are done. Sounds good. I don&amp;rsquo;t even plan to customize default theme for now as typography looks good, theme is supported. Like&amp;hellip; there is everything I need. Most important goal for me is to start accumulate some content.</description>

      <description>About the project It&amp;rsquo;s a SPA kind of web application based on bunch of buzzword technologies, most importantly Web Components. The idea behind picking web components was that over time I will accumulate bunch of reusable components which will be any framework agnostic. At time of creating that project React was the only framework which didn&amp;rsquo;t support web components, but times might be changed since then.
