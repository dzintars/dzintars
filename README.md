  <h2>Now</h2>
  <article>
    <h3>2024-Feb: Gerrit, Zuul-CI, Podman Quadlets</h3>
    <p>Working on Ansible collections for local IDP (Integrated Development
         Platform) setup which consists of multitude of components. Primary
         goal is to get it running smooth on a single developer server by
         utilizing Podman Quadlets. A prototype was done by running it all
         with single Podman kube play deployment, but that was "quick and
         dirty" approach. Current goal is to get neat Ansible collections for
         that.
    </p>
    <p>My GitHub activity stagnates due to migration to self hosted Git
        (Gerrit) server. Some day I might choose to cross-publish my work on
        GitHub. Primary reasoning - "Don't feed the beast".

    <h4>SMBs tech support</h4>
    <p>I am helping some SMBs to maintain their internal infrastructure. Just a little
          things. Some networking, some backups, some reinstalls, some software
          and hardware. Nothing too serious. But it's working for many years.</p>
    <p>In past was also managing old Nortel BMC400 call center server.</p>

  <p>Custom built mechanical keyboard Keeb.io Iris with white blank KAT Alpha

    <p>Using password manager, YubiKey and PGP for improved security.</p>
