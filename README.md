### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Currently busy with learning graphical design and design systems.
Spending most of my day time in Figma and Axure and prototyping some of my project idea.

All of my projects are just some rough drafts to test some ideas and to learn.
My current primary repositories are:

[Frontend](https://github.com/dzintars/front)
Web Components (Lit Element), Redux and TypeScript based SPA frontend.

[Backend](https://github.com/dzintars/wss)
Really basic websockets backend API placeholder written in Go.

I also trying to automate my workstation setup with Ansible in:

[Infra](https://github.com/dzintars/infra)
